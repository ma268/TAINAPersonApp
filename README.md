Things still to improve: 

1. add more custom error messages so that we know where issues are coming from 
2. include exception.message
3. add using statements to automatically clean up resources
4. add more logging especially when there is potential for error…add custom log if it errors.
5. Split up code into a front and and an api 
6. use more async code
7. unit test for repos and controllers
